# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.2.0] - 2023-07-31

### Documentation

- Updated usage section to align with cleaner interface (#27)



- Explain each bench (#29)




### Features

- [**breaking**] Added reflection (#25)

* Reflection on `Ordinal`, `MapDimensions`, `CostField`, `Portals`, `FlowField`, `SectorID`, `FieldCell`, `RouteMetadata` and `FlowFieldMetadata`


### Refactor

- [**breaking**] Replace sector and field tuple IDs with data structures of 'SectorID' and 'FieldCell' (#22)



- [**breaking**] Sector user interface embedded into MapDimension data (#24)

* Sector interface functions are members of `MapDimensions`
  * Methods are gated behind features `2d` and `3d`
* Sector resolution no longer `const`, set at bundle creation allowing for a customised scale factor and very granular fields
  * A `30x30` world with a resolution of `10` will produce a `3x3` sector representation, where a `FieldCell` represents a `1x1` unit area
  * A `30x30` world with a resolution of `3` will produce a `10x10` sector representation, where a `FieldCell` represents a `0.3x0.3` unit area
* Renamed bundle `new_from_disk()` method to `from_ron()` to align with serialising csv 
* Renamed `SectorCostField::from_file()` to `SectorCostField::from_ron()`
* Renamed `CostField::from_file()` to `CostField::from_ron()`
