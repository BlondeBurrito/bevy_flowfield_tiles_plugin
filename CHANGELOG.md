# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.5.1] - 2023-11-24

### Bug Fixes

- Added ratio in feature 3d to convert Vec3 into sector and field (column, row) (#43)




## [0.5.0] - 2023-11-23

### Features

- Updating to bevy 0.12 and prepare 0.5.0 release (#40)




## [0.4.0] - 2023-09-12

### Features

- [**breaking**] Scale impassable cells to close gaps too small for large actor pathing (#32)

Added actor_scale factor to grow the baseline CostFields so that a very wide actor cannot retrieve any FlowFields which would guide them through a narrow gap between 255 impassable cells that's smaller than they are

- Impl line of sight bit flag (#33)

Added a line of sight calculation in the target sector of a PathRequest marking cells that have an unobstructed direct path to the goal. For any FieldCell where the LOS bit flag has been toggled an actor can abandon following the FlowField and move in a direct vector to the goal


### Refactor

- 2d examples make use of colliders and increased timestep (#31)

2d examples have a primitive collider system - this allows for an increased timestep to be used to control actor movement and allowing for more fluid examples


## [0.3.0] - 2023-08-27

### Bug Fixes

- Graph updates should no longer collide due to multiple cost changes (#30)




### Features

- Example of continuous actor spawning




### Miscellaneous Tasks

- Enable feature docs on docrs




## [0.2.0] - 2023-07-31

### Documentation

- Updated usage section to align with cleaner interface (#27)



- Explain each bench (#29)




### Features

- [**breaking**] Added reflection (#25)

* Reflection on `Ordinal`, `MapDimensions`, `CostField`, `Portals`, `FlowField`, `SectorID`, `FieldCell`, `RouteMetadata` and `FlowFieldMetadata`


### Refactor

- [**breaking**] Replace sector and field tuple IDs with data structures of 'SectorID' and 'FieldCell' (#22)



- [**breaking**] Sector user interface embedded into MapDimension data (#24)

* Sector interface functions are members of `MapDimensions`
  * Methods are gated behind features `2d` and `3d`
* Sector resolution no longer `const`, set at bundle creation allowing for a customised scale factor and very granular fields
  * A `30x30` world with a resolution of `10` will produce a `3x3` sector representation, where a `FieldCell` represents a `1x1` unit area
  * A `30x30` world with a resolution of `3` will produce a `10x10` sector representation, where a `FieldCell` represents a `0.3x0.3` unit area
* Renamed bundle `new_from_disk()` method to `from_ron()` to align with serialising csv 
* Renamed `SectorCostField::from_file()` to `SectorCostField::from_ron()`
* Renamed `CostField::from_file()` to `CostField::from_ron()`


## [0.1.0] - 2023-07-24

### Bug Fixes

- Csv to sector costfields support



- Example visualise portals



- Prep 0.1




### Miscellaneous Tasks

- Tidy up warnings



- Allow publishing




### Performance

- Added initial benchmarks




### Refactor
